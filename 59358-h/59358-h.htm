<p>At the turn of the century, the food business was in the &ldquo;cracker
barrel&rdquo; stage. Packaged foods were just beginning to make their
appearance in American grocery stores. It was during this period
that Mr. George J. French developed the idea of marketing bird
seed in packages.</p>
<p>Mr. French, then President of The R. T. French Company,
had raised caged birds for many years as a hobby, and he knew
that a clean, dependable packaged bird food would be welcomed
by canary lovers. The new product was an immediate success. The
sale of branded bird seed in packages brought Mr. French an increasing
flood of letters from bird owners which he carefully
answered himself.</p>
<p>In 1925, using the pen name &ldquo;Bird,&rdquo; he wrote the original
French&rsquo;s Bird Book. As this latest version, &ldquo;All About Your Canary,&rdquo;
is written, French&rsquo;s Bird Seed and Biscuit&mdash;the pioneer in its field&mdash;is
the largest selling bird seed in America.</p>

<p>Lying off the northwest coast of
Africa are two small groups of islands,
the Canary Islands and the Islands of
Madeira. These tiny specks of land are
the habitat of the little green finch,
or wild canary.</p>
<p>The song of these canaries so appealed
to sailors who visited the islands
that quantities of the colorful
birds were captured and carried back
to Europe. By the early 16th century,
these song birds were prized possessions
of many noblemen.</p>
<p>Today the sweet song of the canary
is enjoyed all over the world. In the
patient hands of breeders, the canary
has evolved into many forms and
colors. By 1900 there were twenty-seven
distinct varieties and types of
canary birds.</p>
<p>In Germany there is the famous
Roller singing bird. There is also the
peculiar Dutch bird with all its
feathers turned the wrong way, the
round-shouldered Belgian and Scotch
Fancies, and the beautiful English
birds&mdash;the Lancashire Coppy with
its great crest, the Yorkshire, the Norwich,
and the Border Fancy. Some,
like the London Fancy which had
exquisite orange and black markings
on the head and tail, unfortunately
are already extinct.</p>
<p>The British, who breed their birds
mainly for beauty of plumage and
form, are among the greatest fanciers
in the world. They have hundreds of
societies organized for the purpose of
perfecting particular types of birds.
Regular shows are held all over the
United Kingdom. Dozens of professional
judges are required for the two
large shows in the Royal Horticultural
Hall, Westminster. In December 1948,
hundreds of visitors were turned away
from the Crystal Palace for lack of
room when the National Exhibition
staged a record showing of 5430 birds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
A second huge exhibit at the Crystal
Palace in early 1949 was also filled
to capacity.</p>
<p>The majority of British fanciers are
working men who raise canaries as a
hobby. Championship birds frequently
sell for high prices. At one exhibition
&pound;100 was refused for a canary.</p>
<p>The German breeders were the
first to organize the sale of canaries
on a large scale. In the years following
World War I, German bird brokers
bought canaries from thousands of
individual breeders, collected them at
port cities, and shipped them to New
York. The birds were sold so cheaply
that even after paying an import duty
of 50 cents a bird the New York wholesalers
could resell them profitably for
less than $2.00 each. These birds were
the marvelous singers one used to buy
for $5.00 or less. Needless to say, the
German exporters controlled the popular
market. When importations from
Germany were halted by World War
II, American breeders stepped into
the breach. It is doubtful that our
fanciers will ever give up this interesting
and profitable hobby.</p>
<p>The other great German contribution
to the canary hobby was the development
of the roller singer. The
first rollers to receive recognition were
those developed some years prior to
1890 by a poor German miner named
Trute. The birds which he bred and
trained in his spare time were the
ancestors of the famous &ldquo;Trute strain.&rdquo;
Erntzes, Seiferts, and Volkmans were
other German pioneers. Over the
years since, the roller singer has become
popular everywhere.</p>
<p>There is a vast difference between
the song of the natural chopper and
the roller singer. The natural chopper
might be likened to a folk singer&mdash;the
roller to an operatic star. The chopper&rsquo;s
song is a free, natural expression
of happiness which anyone can appreciate;
while the roller&rsquo;s song, like
the operatic aria, is best understood
and loved by listeners who have developed
a keen ear for subtle distinctions
in expression and tone.</p>
<p>Rollers sing from their throats with
their beaks almost closed. The roller&rsquo;s
song is actually unnatural in that it is
not characteristic of the wild canary.
It has become a trait, however, as a
result of endless training and care in
selective breeding. The roller&rsquo;s song
is composed of rolls or &ldquo;tours&rdquo; of differing
cadence and pitch which are
things of beauty to the hobbyist who
has cultivated an ear for them. Low
pitched tones are considered most
valuable. The more common tours
are called Hollow Roll, Schockel,
Hollow Bell, Water Roll, Glucke,
Bell Glucke, Water Glucke, Bell Roll,
and Flute.</p>
<p>The chopper canary&rsquo;s song is natural.
The standards set up for the
chopper require only that he be a free
and frequent singer; have a sweet tone;
be a pretty bird from the standpoint
of feathering, color and form; and be
lively and energetic. A chopper sings
with open beak, head back, throat
swollen&mdash;the picture of happiness.</p>
<h3 id="c3">CANARIES FOR COMPANIONSHIP</h3>
<p>There is gladness for every member of
the family in the living, loving, happy
companionship of a canary. A canary
in the home helps to build character
in children. It teaches kindness. Its
care gives the boy or girl a feeling of
responsibility. Interest in Nature is
encouraged. Imagination is developed.
Children acquire a protective instinct
that overcomes their tendency to mischievous
cruelty. When the children
have left home, a pair of canaries will
do much to overcome Mom&rsquo;s and
Dad&rsquo;s loneliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In the sick room or the hospital, in
the home for the aged, the schoolroom&mdash;in
fact, almost any place where
the joy of loving companionship is
important&mdash;a happy, singing canary
will do much to brighten the hours.
You may know of someone who needs
such companionship.</p>
<h3 id="c4">BUYING A CANARY</h3>
<p>If you are about to buy a canary, go
to a reputable dealer or breeder. The
best period in which to make your
selection and purchase is from November,
after the birds have completed
their first moult, through May. Explain
what you want, make your own
selection, and take your time about
it. Take a seat in front of the birds.
By watching them, you can soon tell
which are singers. Compare the better
singers one with another; eliminate
one and repeat the process until you
have selected the bird that pleases
you most. Choose a bird that is smooth,
brightly feathered, whose actions are
sharp, crisp and sprightly.</p>
<p>After you have taken him home,
place the carrying cage or box directly
against the open door of the bird&rsquo;s
new home. In a short time the little
chap will go from the carrying cage
without being alarmed, and probably
will soon be singing.</p>
<p>If there is no canary dealer in your
locality, write to the Mail Order Department
of The R. T. French Company,
Rochester 9, New York. From
November through May, except during
the Christmas shipping rush, we
are usually able to ship either French&rsquo;s
Carillons (choppers) or French&rsquo;s Carollers
(rollers) to any express office
in the U.S.A. Both types are selected
birds, guaranteed to arrive in full
health and feather, and to sing within
two weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>General Canary Care</i></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="Frenchy" width="400" height="258" />
</div>
<p>About ten minutes a day is all that
is required for the care of a canary
and its cage. If you have children, let
them share the daily routine. Without
realizing it, they will learn valuable
lessons in kindness and responsibility.</p>
<p>The normal schedule of canary care
is simple. Each morning give your
canary fresh seed and a supply of fresh
water in clean cups. Daily or on alternate
days feed a bit of green food.
Occasionally give him a small amount
of a treat such as song food. Keep a
cuttle bone and a French&rsquo;s Bird Biscuit
in the cage. Allow the bird to
bathe daily, or two or three times a
week. Keep the perches and cage
clean, and a covering of gravel on
the floor.</p>
<p>These are the essentials of canary
care. More detailed information appears
below. Follow the suggestions
made here, and your canary will reward
you with joyful song and years
of happy companionship.</p>
<h3 id="c6">THE CAGE</h3>
<p>Place the cage at eye level in a room
where the temperature is moderate
and fairly even. Choose a light corner
or a place near but to one side of a
bright and cheery window where the
cage is never fully in the direct sunshine
and is away from drafts. When
introducing a bird to a new cage,
place the cage away from the light.
For an hour or two guard against any
noise or movement which may alarm
the bird until he is accustomed to his
new home. It is not necessary to cover
the cage at night unless the room
cools off rapidly to low temperatures
or is frequently lighted.</p>
<p>Modern cages are usually made of
steel, and are rectangular in shape.
Those having a floor size about nine
by fifteen inches are most popular. The
drawer tray should work smoothly.
Lower perches should be arranged
directly beneath upper perches to
avoid fouling, and just far enough in
from the ends to prevent the tail
feathers breaking against the cage
bars. Seed and water cups should have
smooth edges to help prevent loss of
feathers about the head and neck.</p>
<p>Perches should be of soft wood,
preferably in both oval and round
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
shapes, and with different girths, to
simulate the varied perching conditions
encountered by wild birds. The
broad surface of oval perches provides
particularly good support and relaxed,
strainless perching. Gravel-coated
perch covers are not recommended
as they furnish an excellent
hiding place for mites and are irritating
to the feet.</p>
<p>If possible, choose a sturdy, simply
constructed cage with a minimum of
cracks, crevices, and joints which are
difficult to scrub. Many cages are
made in such a way that their entire
bottoms are removable. This is convenient
when giving the bird a bath,
cleaning the cage floor, adding gravel,
and so forth. Always place your hands
on the sides near the bottom when
lifting such a cage. If you were to place
your hands at the top of the cage, the
bird would probably be frightened
and fly out the open bottom.</p>
<h3 id="c7">CAGE CARE</h3>
<p>Routine cage care is as essential to
the cage bird&rsquo;s well-being as a regular
supply of fresh food and water. The
cups and perches should be cleaned
daily, therefore an extra set of each
is desirable. Clean cups are filled with
fresh seed and water in advance and
along with clean perches are set in the
cage when the soiled cups and perches
are removed, scrubbed, and dried
for use the following day. Uneaten
seed can be poured from hand to hand
and the husks and chaff blown off,
then added to fresh seed and reused.
Damp or wet perches are thought to
be harmful.</p>
<p>Take out the drawer tray and dump
the soiled gravel. Wash the tray with
hot suds; rinse, dry, cover it with fresh
gravel, and replace it in the cage. One
advantage of the removable cage bottom
is that if it is soiled it can be withdrawn
and cleaned just before the
clean drawer tray is replaced.</p>
<p>Once a week the cage should be
completely scrubbed with a stiff brush,
good suds, and hot water. Be sure all
cracks and crevices are cleaned out
for they are breeding places for red
mites. While this is going on the bird
may be allowed free flight if the room
is safe; otherwise it should be transferred
to a temporary cage.</p>
<h3 id="c8">FOOD</h3>
<p>Your pet&rsquo;s good health depends on
good treatment, good housing, and
good food. The canary needs fresh
water, nutritious food, and proper
amounts of minerals and vitamins.
Like other members of the hard-billed
finch family, the canary&rsquo;s main food
requirement is seeds, as its sturdy
seed-cracking bill indicates. In nature
he finds supplies of calcium and other
minerals for bone, feather, and egg
production, in addition to seeds and
greens. Although he is not primarily
an insect eater, the canary relishes
insects and their larvae, as do other
members of the finch family.</p>
<h3 id="c9">VITAMIN B&#8321;&#8322; SUPPLEMENT</h3>
<p>Some years ago, poultry experts discovered
one reason why chickens that
ran outdoors were superior to those
always kept indoors and never allowed
to run free. Those permitted to scratch
outdoors were benefiting from something
in the soil, something derived
from animal matter: The scientists
called it APF, meaning animal protein
factor. They learned to isolate it and
to put it into diet supplements for
livestock. The results were amazing;
poultry grew faster and larger, hatched
more eggs, reared more hatchlings,
and replaced moulted feathers more
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The scientists then discovered that
the most important component of
APF for growth and hatchability was
a red vitamin, B&#8321;&#8322;. It was found to be
one of the most effective therapeutic
substances known for its weight. As
little as 1/200th of a teaspoon of pure
B&#8321;&#8322; to a ton of livestock feed is considered
adequate!</p>
<p>B&#8321;&#8322; was first isolated from liver by
research workers in England. Since
then processors have learned to extract
it from fermentation products
at a more reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The R. T. French Laboratory,
noting the effect of B&#8321;&#8322; on poultry and
hogs, began a long series of tests with
canaries and parrakeets. French&rsquo;s had
pioneered in the past in packaging
bird seed, in air-washing it to remove
dust, in eliminating the over-use of
hempseed, in producing a balanced
bird diet, and in the use of yeast and
wheat germ supplements. This Vitamin
B&#8321;&#8322; research was a part of French&rsquo;s
never-ending program of bringing to
bird owners the new products and
techniques of science as soon as they
can be authoritatively documented.
A year passed before French&rsquo;s laboratory
reported these four apparent facts:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. B&#8321;&#8322; is non-toxic</dt>
<dt>2. B&#8321;&#8322; improves the palatability of the food to which it is added (birds like it)</dt>
<dt>3. B&#8321;&#8322; promotes feathering</dt>
<dt>4. B&#8321;&#8322; hastens the development of young birds.</dt></dl>
<p>The significance of the last two
points is important to all bird owners.
In moulting, for instance, the loss and
replacement of feathers is a severe tax
on a bird&rsquo;s general health, and an
improperly feathered bird is at a
great disadvantage. Furthermore, nutrition
experts place great importance
on the growth and development which
foods produce in young animals and
birds. Foods which support the best
rates of development are naturally
considered the most desirable.</p>
<p>Vitamin B&#8321;&#8322; was included in the
formulas for French&rsquo;s Bird Biscuit and
French&rsquo;s Nestling Food only after the
company had been convinced that
the addition of B&#8321;&#8322; would be a real
contribution to canary and parrakeet
nutrition. Bird owners will do well to
feed vitamin B&#8321;&#8322; regularly. This can
be done by keeping the biscuit in the
cage at all times. Sick or run-down
birds, in particular, should have the
biscuit or the nestling food.</p>
<h3 id="c10">ABOUT FEEDING DAINTIES</h3>
<p>Most persons like to give their pets a
treat now and then. An occasional
treat is always relished and is usually
beneficial. Wild seeds you have gathered
are excellent. French&rsquo;s Song Food
and French&rsquo;s Bird Biscuit are treats
most canaries enjoy. French&rsquo;s Sunshine
Food is especially helpful during
winter months. These French&rsquo;s treats
are excellent nutritional supplements
which the canary enjoys. Follow the
directions on each package, and your
canary will be benefited out of all
proportion to the small amount fed.</p>
<h3 id="c11">BIRDS NEED MINERALS</h3>
<p>Extensive research with chickens has
indicated that for proper nutrition and
good health birds require quite a long
list of minerals, some in fairly substantial
amounts, others in only minute
traces. The trace minerals and many
of the others are present in sufficient
quantity in the foods regularly fed.</p>
<p>Calcium is required in larger
amounts and is best supplied by keeping
a cuttle bone in the cage at all
times. The cuttle bone is the backbone
of the saltwater cuttle fish and provides
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
a ready source of calcium and
several other required minerals. If the
cuttle bone becomes soiled or dusty,
replace it with a fresh one. Add a tiny
pinch of salt to a treat cup of Song
Food or Sunshine Food once a week.</p>
<p>Occasionally dry and sterilize a few
egg shells when you are using the oven.
Crushed and sprinkled in with the
gravel, these make good supplemental
sources of calcium.</p>
<h3 id="c12">IMPORTANCE OF BIRD GRAVEL</h3>
<p>Nature did not supply your Canary
with teeth to help grind his food. The
food goes directly to the crop where
it is mixed with digestive juices and
softened. Thence it passes to the
gizzard, where with the aid of gravel
previously swallowed, it is &ldquo;ground
up&rdquo; for assimilation. The gizzard is a
small thick pouch with very tough,
muscular walls which rub against each
other at great pressure. When gravel
is present, this action grinds the food
into a soft, easily digested mass. Therefore
it is essential that your canary
have free access to a plentiful supply
of gravel of the right kind and size.
Gravel composed of limestone or
magnesia should not be used, because
it is readily dissolved by the bird&rsquo;s
digestive juices. Beach sand may have
harmful impurities and is usually worn
and rounded.</p>
<p>Gravel should be hard, sharp rather
than round, and not affected by
digestive juices. French&rsquo;s Bird Gravel
is crushed silica sandstone quartz and
meets these requirements perfectly.
It is thoroughly washed, carefully
screened to a uniform size, and then
sterilized by heat. When sprinkled on
the floor of the cage, it helps keep the
bird&rsquo;s feet in condition by wearing off
the scales and dirt, and it is a distinct
aid in keeping the cage floor clean
and dry.</p>
<h3 id="c13">FEEDING GREEN FOODS</h3>
<p>One of the best green foods for birds
is a slice of sweet apple or orange
placed between the bars of the cage.
Chickweed and watercress are also
good. Many bird owners feed lettuce,
which is satisfactory; but it must be
examined carefully and any frozen
parts removed. The long stalks of the
rattail plantain weed are much relished.
You can keep them several days by
standing them in water. Before giving
them to the bird, cut off the ends. Both
flowers and the tender new leaves
of dandelions are pleasing and
beneficial to canaries.</p>
<p>An interesting and simple way to
provide greens for your pet is to scatter
a pinch or two of French&rsquo;s Bird Seed
on the soil surface of some of your
house plants. The seeds soon root and
make excellent greens.</p>
<p>Sprouted seed is a wonderful treat.
Place one teaspoonful of seed per bird
in water and allow it to stand overnight.
In the morning rinse the seed in
two or three clear tepid waters and
spread on a moist clean towel. The
tiny sprouts will soon break through
and the seed may be dried and fed.
Renew daily, for soaked, sprouted seed
spoils fast.</p>
<h3 id="c14">WILD SEEDS FOR CANARIES</h3>
<p>Gathering seeds can be a delightful
pastime. The following are most
beneficial: seed heads of seeding
grasses, Plantain, Chickweed, Shepherd&rsquo;s
Purse, Dock Groundsel, Clover,
Teazle, Queen Anne&rsquo;s Lace, Charlock,
Smartweed, dandelion and
thistles, except Burdock. These seeds
are particularly good at moulting and
mating times and a few are always
relished as a treat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c15">INSECT FOOD</h3>
<p>Meal worms, the stand-by food of
bird fanciers who keep soft-bills as
pets, are a real delicacy and are very
beneficial for canaries, especially during
the breeding and moulting seasons,
or when a bird is run-down as a result
of soft moult. Meal worms are the
larvae of the small grain moths such
as are prevalent in any cereal product,
and which you sometimes find in bird
seed. Meal worms can often be raised
as a profitable side line and sold to
pet shops.</p>
<h3 id="c16">EGG FOOD</h3>
<p>Egg food is a required food supplement
at mating and moulting. It is made by
mashing a 30-minute hard cooked egg
with enough toasted whole wheat
bread crumbs to give a crumbly moist
mixture. Crushed cracker crumbs,
Pablum, chick starter mash, or
French&rsquo;s Nestling Food may be substituted
for the whole wheat bread
crumbs to provide variety. Egg food
spoils quickly. As a precaution, any
remaining in the cup or scattered on
the cage floor should be removed
within two or three hours.</p>
<p>Egg food can be kept a short while
under refrigeration, but it should be
fed at room temperature, rather than
cold. At the first off taste or odor it
should be discarded, and a fresh lot
prepared. French&rsquo;s Nestling Food
moistened with water or scalded milk
makes a reliable egg food substitute
for occasional feeding.</p>
<h3 id="c17">COLOR FEEDING FOR CANARIES</h3>
<p>It has long been the custom for bird
fanciers to add certain substances to
the diet during moulting which will
tint the bird&rsquo;s plumage to colors ranging
from deep yellow to orange or red.</p>
<p>To do this, start feeding color
food at the beginning of the moult. The
food is prepared as follows: to a hard
boiled egg add two or three crackers
and a half-teaspoonful of fresh paprika.
Mix well together with two or three
drops of olive oil to form a paste and
supply each bird with a teaspoonful of
the mixture daily. Each morning give
a fresh supply. After the first week
gradually increase the amount of the
color food until the desired color is
reached. The amount may then be
gradually decreased until the end of
the moult, when color-feeding should
be discontinued, as it is effective only
while feathers are growing. French&rsquo;s
Moulting Food and this color food in
equal amounts, moistened with a drop
or two of olive oil, is an effective
mixture relished by canaries.</p>
<p>Once or twice a week, a small
portion of flaxseed should be mixed
with the regular seed. Other delicacies
should be withheld, as they
may induce the birds to neglect their
color food. Use great care to exclude
drafts. Avoid keeping the birds in a
strong light, as this may fade the tints
you are trying to obtain. It may be
well on very bright days to lay a cloth
over the bright side of the cage.
French&rsquo;s Iron Compound should be
given in doses of 8 to 10 drops to the
drinking-cup, if your bird seems off
its feed.</p>
<h3 id="c18">BATHING</h3>
<p>A bird should be trained to bathe in a
regular bathing dish at least three
times a week. Any small, shallow dish
may be used for a bathing dish. If the
cage bottom is not removable, the
dish should be small enough to pass
through the cage door. The outside
baths that hang over the cage door
opening are practical and easy to use.
Fill the dish or bath with about one
half inch of cool water.</p>
<p>Many owners have found that birds
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
can be tempted into their bathing dish
by floating a small bit of green food
or a few seeds on the surface. The bird
picks these out of the water, finds it is
rather pleasant, and is soon enjoying
his bath. If this is not successful, try
placing a small mirror in the bottom
of the bathing dish. Sometimes the
bird is attracted into the water when
it sees its own image.</p>
<p>In very warm summer weather, the
bird will enjoy a bath each day but in
winter allow a bath only two or three
mornings a week. Never force your
bird to bathe. If he persists in bathing
from his drinking cup, remove or
empty the cup while the bathing dish
is in the cage.</p>
<p>The bird&rsquo;s feet should be examined
to see that they are clean and healthy.
The feet of birds inclined to shirk their
bath often become caked. If this condition
is found, the feet should be
soaked in warm water, and the
accumulations gently removed. It is
then well to rub a little sweet oil into
the bird&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h3 id="c19">ESCAPED BIRD</h3>
<p>One day when you have the cage door
open, or the floor of the cage removed
for cleaning, your pet may escape and
fly about the room. If this happens, do
not chase or grab at the bird. He will
become frightened, and if you catch
him, you may grasp him too firmly.</p>
<p>If your pet escapes, remain calm.
First shut all the doors and windows in
the room, and turn off any open flames
on the kitchen range if the bird is loose
in the kitchen. Pull down the shades
and turn off the lights. When the room
is darkened, the bird will cease to fly
about. Then you can easily approach
it, take it gently in your cupped hand,
and return it to the cage. If you cannot
darken the room, just prop open the
cage door. Left alone, most birds will
fly back inside the cage for food and
water in a short time.</p>
<p>If the bird gets out-of-doors it will
not usually fly farther than a nearby
shrub or tree. Again, tie the cage door
open and set the cage where the bird
can see it, and the canary will usually
come &ldquo;home&rdquo; in short while. The
main thing is to keep calm and avoid
frightening or injuring the bird.</p>
<p>When the weather is warm, an
escaped bird perching on a low shrub
or branch is sometimes caught easily
after his feathers have been dampened
by a fine mist from the garden hose.
This method should never be used in
cold weather.</p>
<h3 id="c20">EXERCISE AND PLAY</h3>
<p>Birds in small cages need exercise. Tie
a few strands of worsted to the top of
the cage for your canary to tug on,
and sometimes dangle a small bright
key or other metal object from the top
of the cage. A small bell suspended in
the cage will sometimes attract and
hold the interest of the bird when
nothing else will. Canaries like attention
and excitement. Talk to them
frequently. They are usually fond of
music too, and will often try to drown
it with their own notes.</p>
<p>Allowing the canary to have the
freedom of the room provides it both
pleasure and exercise. The dangers are
that the bird may injure itself or that
it will pick up something not good for
it to eat. If you decide in favor, prop
or tie the cage door open and let the
bird return to the cage by itself. Have
a regular time, such as when cleaning
the cage.</p>
<h3 id="c21">CATS</h3>
<p>The cat is a natural enemy of small
birds. If a cat is kept in the home, be
sure to hang the cage where the cat
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
cannot reach it or knock it down by
leaping on it.</p>
<h3 id="c22">MICE</h3>
<p>Mice are especially fond of bird seed.
At night they sometimes enter the
room where the bird is kept and eat
the seeds which have fallen on the
floor. They will often reach the cage
by climbing up a curtain or drape.
A bird is thus frightened and disturbed
at a time when it should be asleep, and
as a result it will be drowsy in the daytime,
lose its gay spirits, and fail to
sing. See that the cage is not hung in
a place where mice can reach it.</p>
<h3 id="c23">TAMING A CANARY</h3>
<p>A canary is easily tamed. Take a tiny
pinch of French&rsquo;s Song Food and
moisten it in your lips. Raise your
hand slowly and spread the moistened
food on the cage bars near an upper
perch. Out of curiosity, the canary will
hop over to see what you have placed
on the bar, pick at it, and enjoy eating
it. Do this once or twice a day, and
in a short time you will find he is
accustomed to your presence and will
pick the food from your fingers. Birds
like to feed from the lips. After a bird
has taken a treat from your finger,
place a bit between your lips. If he
takes it from you, you can rest assured
that you have his confidence and
probably will always have it.</p>
<h3 id="c24">HOW TO SHIP A CANARY</h3>
<p>A cardboard carton approximately
8&Prime; &times; 8&Prime; &times; 12&Prime; is suitable for shipping one
or two canaries. Cover all joints inside
the bottom of box with gummed tape
to prevent loss of feed supply by sifting.
Cut a row of six small holes near the
top for ventilation. Next cut an opening
on one side for a window. The
window need not be more than 3&Prime;
square. In cool weather cover this
opening with reinforced, transparent
plastic window material, usually available
at hardware stores or poultry
supply dealers. In warm weather, use
a small square of regular wire screen,
secured in place with heavy package
wrapping tape. Cut an opening on the
opposite side for a door approximately
3&Prime; square, leaving one of the four sides
uncut to act as a hinge. Use a clean
evaporated milk can for a water cup.
Cut an opening about one inch square
in the top of the can near the edge.
Place the can on the floor of the box
against the two sides forming a corner
near the window. The opening in the
top of the can should be toward the
center of the box. Secure the can in
position with a piece of wire. Loop the
wire around the can and run the ends
through the two sides of the box forming
the corner. The ends of the wire
should then be folded flat and held in
place with tape. Filling the container
half full of clean imitation sponge will
help to prevent the water in the can
from spilling.</p>
<p>Using small tacks, nail a perch across
the narrow width of the box at the
window end 1&frac12;&Prime; from the floor and
close enough to the water container
so that the canary can reach it from
the perch. The perch must not be
closer than four inches from the end
of the box to prevent injury to the
bird&rsquo;s tail feathers.</p>
<p>To provide additional moisture,
wire a half an orange to the corner
of the box nearest the other end of the
perch. The orange should be placed
so the bird can reach it easily from the
perch. The sliced side of the orange
should face into the box, and the wires
should be taped on the outside. Scatter
several tablespoons of seed and a few
teaspoons of gravel on the floor. Seal
the box at the top with gummed tape.

<p>Each bird in this collection of thirty-six life-size canary
portraits was painted from an actual live model carefully
selected to typify the best qualities of a particular
breed or type. To appreciate fully the beauty of these
paintings, stand the book upright and view them at a
distance of from four to five feet as you would paintings
in an exhibition gallery. North light will be found better
than most artificial illumination.</p>
<p>William C. Dilger, one of America&rsquo;s most talented
ornithological artists, painted these outstanding canary
portraits. At the time the paintings were made, Mr.
Dilger was completing work for his Doctor&rsquo;s degree at
Cornell University. Mr. Dilger has had many years of
experience in the field of bird painting. As a boy, he
found his greatest pleasure in drawing birds. Even while
in the Army in World War II, he found time to continue
his study by sketching wild birds native to India and the
Far East. This collection of paintings truly represents a
&ldquo;labor of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. George F. Mitchell of Toronto, Canada, one of
the continent&rsquo;s most highly regarded bird show judges,
supervised the descriptions in the &ldquo;Gallery Catalogue&rdquo;
and served as consultant throughout the preparation
of the paintings. Mr. Mitchell is well-known both in
Canada and the United States for his efforts in connection
with bird shows.</p>
<p class="center small">BIRDS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ORDER OF APPEARANCE</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small"><i>The Gallery Catalogue</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c27">YELLOW ROLLER CANARY</h3>
<p>The roller canary is bred primarily for song,
hence the form, feather, size, and substance
of this roller makes it most exceptional. Most
rollers are no more than five inches in length,
with a much flatter appearing head and
straighter back and are lacking in the solid
girth of this bird. With the advent of color
breeding, many of the foremost U. S. roller
fanciers are experimenting with color, size,
and form improvements, as shown in this
advanced type. <a class="jr small" href="#fig1">PLATE 1</a></p>
<h3 id="c28">YELLOW CHOPPER IN SONG</h3>
<p>The chopper opens its beak wide in attaining
some of its clear, free notes. The song of the
chopper varies from that of the roller to the
loud, full song of the average &ldquo;type&rdquo; canary,
including the song of various crosses between
the canary and birds of related families.
There are no standards for the song of the
chopper other than that it be cheerful, lively,
and free. Its action should be lively and alert. <a class="jr small" href="#fig2">PLATE 2</a></p>
<h3 id="c29">VARIEGATED YELLOW ROLLER IN SONG</h3>
<p>The almost closed beak is typical of the roller
in full song. This characteristic, plus the
much prized low pitched song tours such as
the Hollow Roll, Bass, and Koller serve to
distinguish the roller canary. Tone quality
is just as important as range. There is some
possibility that the use of rape seed is at least
partly responsible for the lower pitch of their
most valued tours. <a class="jr small" href="#fig3">PLATE 3</a></p>
<h3 id="c30">GREEN CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>The canary breeder usually specializes in
type, color, or song. It is not unusual for a
breeder to produce a hundred canaries for
every worthwhile bird retained for further
breeding. The remaining birds are mostly
sold to pet stores. Hence, in the chopper
classification there appear all colors, shapes,
and sizes, and this green bird obviously has
inherited much Border Fancy Blood. <a class="jr small" href="#fig4">PLATE 4</a></p>
<h3 id="c31">VARIEGATED CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>In canaries, marked birds are more usual
than birds of solid colors, and are known
among breeders as variegated birds. The
variegated, with irregular or even markings,
often provides the individualism that appeals
to a prospective bird owner who buys a
canary as a gift. Evenly balanced markings
that are exactly repeated on each side of the
bird are fairly rare. <a class="jr small" href="#fig5">PLATE 5</a></p>
<h3 id="c32">CINNAMON CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>The rich yellow-brown cinnamon coloring
is an important variation in canaries. Being
most attractive in itself, in addition, it is the
basis for the delightful fawn coloring. The
cinnamon pictured here has a well formed
body, just a bit thick in the neck. Pencilling
in a cinnamon is a deeper shade of the same
yellow-brown body color, and similarly,
the ends of the flight feathers can be an
even deeper yellow-brown shade. <a class="jr small" href="#fig6">PLATE 6</a></p>
<h3 id="c33">BLUE CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Blue&rdquo; refers to slate or smoky gray coloring.
The body conformation of this blue canary
shows unmistakable Border Fancy Canary
ancestry. In many blues the pencilling over
the back is less distinct than in this specimen,
and often there is considerable marking or
variegation. <a class="jr small" href="#fig7">PLATE 7</a></p>
<h3 id="c34">WHITE CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>In a white canary the white should be as
pure as possible. The feathering of the canary
illustrated is very good and the body conformation
is pleasing. Some whites show
faint colorings which are inherited and are
natural to whites from crossing yellow and
white canaries. Pure whites are rare and
very valuable. <a class="jr small" href="#fig8">PLATE 8</a></p>
<h3 id="c35">FAWN CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>In the fawn, the yellow of the yellow-brown
cinnamon coloring is absent, leaving a rich
brown background. This delightful mutation
is now present in type birds and rollers. <a class="jr small" href="#fig9">PLATE 9</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c36">CLEAR CAP GOLD LIZARD CANARY</h3>
<p>The distinctive Lizard Canaries, silver cap
and gold cap, are regaining some of their
previous popularity. The Gold Lizard shown
here shows the lizard markings across the
back and shoulders more attractively than
does our Silver Lizard. These two birds were
imported, as were others used for these reproductions.
They have exceptionally good
lizard markings and size. <a class="jr small" href="#fig10">PLATE 10</a></p>
<h3 id="c37">CLEAR CAP SILVER LIZARD CANARY</h3>
<p>The Silver Lizard Canary shown here has
good size and excellent feathering and
markings. Lizard Canaries offer the fancier
an opportunity to show birds of much interest
to the casual viewer. <a class="jr small" href="#fig11">PLATE 11</a></p>
<h3 id="c38">YELLOW BORDER FANCY CANARY</h3>
<p>The Border Fancy Canary has outstanding
beauty and delicacy of form. The Yellow
Border Fancy Canary is the ideal sought by
perhaps nineteen out of twenty Border
breeders. <a class="jr small" href="#fig12">PLATE 12</a></p>
<h3 id="c39">YELLOW-GREEN BORDER FANCY CANARY</h3>
<p>The green in this bird is an excellent foil for
the almost black pencilling which appears
on the shoulder, back, and flank. The feathering
is well depicted. The green color
should be close to that of the upperside of a
holly leaf. These heavily colored green birds
are the pride and joy of many canary fanciers,
and the development of an ideal green
is a real challenge to any fancier. <a class="jr small" href="#fig13">PLATE 13</a></p>
<h3 id="c40">TICKED BUFF BORDER FANCY CANARY</h3>
<p>This lifelike portrayal shows exceptional
feather detail and the ground color is excellent
for a Buff. The wings and tail of the
bird are unusually good; the legs and feet
very natural. Note the tick mark back of
the eye. <a class="jr small" href="#fig14">PLATE 14</a></p>
<h3 id="c41">MINIATURE FAWN BORDER FANCY CANARY</h3>
<p>The body of this canary shows good conformation,
feathering, and position. The
richness of the fawn coloring is little short
of ideal.</p>
<p>On the perch, a good Border from eye to
end of tail, shows an angle of about 60&deg;
above horizontal. A Miniature Border retains
all of the form, feathering and coloring
of the ideal Border but is smaller in size. <a class="jr small" href="#fig15">PLATE 15</a></p>
<h3 id="c42">CINNAMON-MARKED NORWICH CANARY</h3>
<p>The effect of cinnamon blood is considered
to be of great value by many breeders. The
standard for feathering is softness and silky
texture with brilliancy and compactness.
The feathering of this bird is exceptional.
Evenness and fine texture are characteristic
of the cinnamon canary. General form and
position is close to the ideal. <a class="jr small" href="#fig16">PLATE 16</a></p>
<h3 id="c43">PLAIN HEAD CLEAR BUFF NORWICH CANARY</h3>
<p>The bird shown is ideally formed and nicely
balanced. It is well up off the perch, and
its feathering is clean and smooth. It is a
natural color Norwich (not color fed) and
is particularly lifelike. <a class="jr small" href="#fig17">PLATE 17</a></p>
<h3 id="c44">COLORFED NORWICH PLAIN HEAD CANARY</h3>
<p>The beautiful flame tint of this bird is accomplished
by feeding special color food
when new feathers are growing. In the ideal
Norwich, feathers are soft and silky with
brilliancy and compactness, and are deep,
bright, rich, pure and level in color. <a class="jr small" href="#fig18">PLATE 18</a></p>
<h3 id="c45">WING-MARKED DARK CRESTED NORWICH CANARY</h3>
<p>This spectacular bird is beautifully feathered
as well as almost ideally formed. The crest
correctly covers eyes and beak and is exceptionally
even. Crest bred birds generally
possess longer feathers than plain head types
and have a tendency toward looseness of
feather, hence the close feathering of this
crested bird portrays the ideal. <a class="jr small" href="#fig19">PLATE 19</a></p>
<h3 id="c46">WHITE YORKSHIRE CANARY</h3>
<p>The erect fearlessness of the Yorkshire type
is shown here. The feathering of this bird
is excellent and its stance upon the perch is
characteristic of this bold and alert canary.
Note the long, well-placed legs topped by
slim thighs. <a class="jr small" href="#fig20">PLATE 20</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c47">CLEAR YELLOW YORKSHIRE CANARY</h3>
<p>The ideal Yorkshire Canary is a favorite of
fanciers all over the world. It is a soldier-like
bird with graceful outline, bold and
fearless expression, and smart lines and
movements. <a class="jr small" href="#fig21">PLATE 21</a></p>
<h3 id="c48">WING-MARKED YORKSHIRE CANARY</h3>
<p>The stance of this canary is excellent. Note
its tapering wedge shape which is a characteristic
of the Yorkshire Canary Club
ideal. <a class="jr small" href="#fig22">PLATE 22</a></p>
<h3 id="c49">BUFF YORKSHIRE CANARY</h3>
<p>The silky feathering of the Buff canary is
well developed in this specimen. In Buff
feathering the yellow pigmentation does
not extend down into the tips of the feathers.
As a result the bird is lighter in color and
should have a frosted appearance across the
shoulders. <a class="jr small" href="#fig23">PLATE 23</a></p>
<h3 id="c50">SCOTCH FANCY CANARY</h3>
<p>The Scotch Fancy was once extensively bred
to develop this strange posture but is almost
extinct today. Without doubt, the unnatural
formation of this type is the cause of its
gradual disappearance. The canary shown
here was painted from one of the few remaining
specimens and was imported directly
from England for the purpose of making
this illustration. <a class="jr small" href="#fig24">PLATE 24</a></p>
<h3 id="c51">LANCASHIRE COPPY CANARY</h3>
<p>The Lancashire Coppy, regrettably, is also
being bred much less extensively today. It
is an outstandingly large, erect bird&mdash;a veritable
giant compared to the average roller
or chopper canary. The difficulties faced by
breeders of this type are many since the
effort to produce increasingly large birds
has led to considerable deterioration in other
desirable characteristics, such as feathering. <a class="jr small" href="#fig25">PLATE 25</a></p>
<h3 id="c52">GLOSTER CANARY</h3>
<p>The Gloster Canary is a heavily crested
bird, much smaller than the Norwich. The
crest itself comes down, ideally, almost level
with the center of the eye. The feathering
of the specimen we show here is outstanding
in quality because of its compactness and
its fine texture. <a class="jr small" href="#fig26">PLATE 26</a></p>
<h3 id="c53">EUROPEAN GOLDFINCH</h3>
<p>The red face of this alert bird distinguishes
it from other finches. The goldfinch breeds
freely in the aviary and is kept not only because
of its own attractiveness, but because
it readily breeds with other finches, including
canaries. <a class="jr small" href="#fig27">PLATE 27</a></p>
<h3 id="c54">CANARY AND EUROPEAN GOLDFINCH CROSS</h3>
<p>This cross provides some very outstanding
singers. The goldfinch ancestry of this bird
shows in its orange face and the traces of
yellow wing bars. Its canary ancestry is
evident in its beak, posture and conformation. <a class="jr small" href="#fig28">PLATE 28</a></p>
<h3 id="c55">CANARY AND EUROPEAN LINNET CROSS</h3>
<p>The linnet is popular for breeding mules
and hybrids because it is one of the most
outstanding singers among our finches. The
effects of the linnet are especially clear in
the coloring of the head, back and wings of
this lifelike illustration. <a class="jr small" href="#fig29">PLATE 29</a></p>
<h3 id="c56">MALE VENEZUELAN BLACK-HOODED RED SISKIN</h3>
<p>The canary and siskin cross was considered
infertile for many years just as are many
other canary hybrids. Fortunately it was
discovered that these hybrids were sometimes
fertile when crossed back with a canary,
furnishing a new incentive to thousands of
canary fanciers now on the trail of both an
all-red and an all-black canary. Today,
many fanciers believe that the introduction
of the Black-hooded Red Siskin&rsquo;s blood will
provide the means of producing a red
canary. <a class="jr small" href="#fig30">PLATE 30</a></p>
<h3 id="c57">FEMALE VENEZUELAN BLACK-HOODED RED SISKIN</h3>
<p>This attractive but much less lively colored
&ldquo;other half&rdquo; of the Black-hooded Red Siskin
will also produce fertile canary hybrids.
The female siskin illustrates very well the
dimorphic colorations common to many
wild birds, being slightly orange in many
of the areas showing deepest red in the male
Black-hooded Red Siskin.</p>
<p>These siskins are considerably smaller than
even very small canaries, and they have an
unattractive wild song. As might be expected,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
their coloring, size, and song characteristics
are transmitted to the hybrids resulting
from crossing with the canary. The fancier,
through selective breeding back to desirable
canary stock, endeavors to eliminate the
unwanted siskin characteristics and at the
same time retain the effect of the red coloring
which produces many shades of apricot,
orange and copper. <a class="jr small" href="#fig31">PLATE 31</a></p>
<h3 id="c58">MAHOGANY CANARY AND SISKIN 1ST CROSS</h3>
<p>The canary and siskin hybrid is always a
very dark bird and usually small in size.
Depending on the depth of color they are
usually called a copper, bronze, or mahogany.
When these hybrids are mated back
to pure canary stock, the chicks obtained
are called second cross and generally have
a much more attractive appearance. <a class="jr small" href="#fig32">PLATE 32</a></p>
<h3 id="c59">ORANGE-CINNAMON CANARY AND SISKIN 2ND CROSS</h3>
<p>The deep orange coloring of this second
cross hybrid was obtained from a fertile
canary and siskin first cross that was mated
back to canary stock carrying some cinnamon
blood. The orange tint has little, if
any, tendency to fade and is often as bright
as that temporarily obtained through color
feeding. In a second cross bird such as this,
the siskin heritage is usually very noticeable
in the song. <a class="jr small" href="#fig33">PLATE 33</a></p>
<h3 id="c60">APRICOT CANARY AND SISKIN 3RD CROSS</h3>
<p>When the second cross canary and siskin is
mated back to pure canary stock again, the
apricot coloring is one of the possible results.
This bird illustrates the way in which the
Red Siskin coloring has been diluted and
evenly spread throughout. The apricot stock
is used by breeders in crossing with unrelated
hybrid stock in order to intensify desired
coloring, form, feathering, and size
characteristics as well as to further introduce
the color to type birds such as Border
Fancies. <a class="jr small" href="#fig34">PLATE 34</a></p>
<h3 id="c61">FROSTED PINK CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>The frosted pink canary is usually considerably
removed from the first canary and
siskin cross and it represents much progress.
Many fanciers are concentrating on this
pink coloration rather than the deep orange
colorings in their work toward producing
the red canary. <a class="jr small" href="#fig35">PLATE 35</a></p>
<h3 id="c62">DILUTE HEN CHOPPER CANARY</h3>
<p>The dilute factor was discovered by accident
some years ago by a fancier keen
enough to recognize something of its potential
value. When this factor is present it dilutes
by graying or thinning out otherwise
standard colors. If it were not for this dilute
factor in the bird illustrated, the cinnamon
markings and the yellow would have been
noticeably deeper in color. <a class="jr small" href="#fig36">PLATE 36</a></p>

<h3 id="c64">SELECTING THE BIRDS</h3>
<p>The chances are you already own one
of the birds you plan to use for breeding.
For best prospects the male
should be healthy and sleek, a good
singer, and between twelve months
and four years old. The hen should
also be healthy and sleek, from one
to five years old, and should differ
from the cock bird in coloring. For
example, with the cock a yellow, the
hen could be a lighter colored buff,
or vice versa. Pair yellow and buff,
green and white, cinnamon and white,
yellow and green, and so on. Your
hens should be vigorous and if not
overbred (used for more than two
nests the previous season) it is a good
thing to use those with proved capacity
on your first attempt.</p>
<p>Most breeders allow the hens to
have flying exercise daily. For this
purpose a flight cage or room is best,
and if you intend to mate several
pairs, it is a good investment. Its size
can depend on the space available.
A very useful flying cage is four
feet long, two feet high, and one-and-a-half
to two feet deep. Place the
seed at one end, the water at the other,
and keep the perches widely spaced
in order to insure exercise. Smaller
flights can be used satisfactorily, and
if a spare room is available its whole
area can be used. Many successful
breeders use attic space divided into
flight rooms with hardware cloth and
screen doors. The floor of each flight
room is covered with gravel.</p>
<h3 id="c65">BREEDING CAGES AND NESTS</h3>
<p>One of the best breeding cages for
canaries is metal, box-shaped, with
two sliding partitions in the middle,
one of regular cage wire, the other of
sheet metal. It is about twenty-four
inches long, eleven inches high and
eleven inches deep. The bottom and
tray are removable, and there are
sliding doors in the front of each compartment.
In addition, there should
be a swinging door in the upper rear
corner of each end.</p>
<p>Nests are hung in the corners by
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
these doors, so that the top of the nest
is about one inch higher than the
perch. The nesting material should
consist of specially prepared nesting
hair, moss, shredded burlap, short
pieces of string or such material. Line
the nests with warm cloth pads. Use
two when necessary. Sew the pads to
the nest using short stitches inside and
long outside to prevent the hen from
catching her feet in the stitches. As a
precaution, dust the lining thoroughly
with insect powder.</p>
<p>We shall be glad to supply plans
for home built breeding cages, flight
cages, and outside aviaries on request.
Write us what you have in mind.</p>
<h3 id="c66">EARLY SEASON CHORES</h3>
<p>Select a shielded location for the
breeding cage. Wild birds seek seclusion
and privacy when they nest, and
will often leave the nest and eggs entirely
if disturbed, and relocate in a
better hiding place. Although canaries
have been bred in cages for hundreds
of years, this tendency to desert the
nest and nestlings persists. The breeding
cage should have a solid foundation
and the perches should be tried
individually to be sure that they are
steady and firm.</p>
<p>Provide a flashlight for the breeding
room. It will come in handy for brief
nighttime checkups on the birds;
for removing the male, which is best
done at night; and for candling the
eggs after the hen has been setting
for about six days. Provide a small
cardboard box half filled with a dry
cereal such as corn meal, or with
cotton. This receptacle is for the first
few eggs and its use is explained in
the paragraph &ldquo;<a href="#c69">Round One</a>.&rdquo; Another
early season chore is to secure
three or four dummy canary eggs.
Such dummy eggs can be purchased
from pet dealers, but a small &#8540;&Prime;
diameter marble or wooden ball will
suffice. Their use is also explained
under &ldquo;<a href="#c69">Round One</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c67">GETTING THE BIRDS READY</h3>
<p>Early in January the birds should
have their nails trimmed, if overlong,
to prevent punctured eggs or accidental
harm to the nestlings. Allow
the hen as much flying exercise as
possible. If you have no flight cage,
the added exercise she will get in the
breeding cage, with the partitions removed,
will be helpful.</p>
<p>In early February the regular seed
diet should be supplemented with egg
food. This is prepared by sieving a
30-minute boiled egg and mixing
with toasted bread crumbs etc., to a
crumbly consistency. See &ldquo;<a href="#c16">Egg Food</a>&rdquo;
in &ldquo;<a href="#c5">General Care</a>&rdquo; section. A little
poppy seed sprinkled over the portion
given each bird is beneficial. A daily
teaspoonful of this mixture for each
bird is sufficient until the early part
of March. About once a week scatter
a little ground oyster shell on the cage
floor with the gravel, and keep a cuttle
bone in the cage at all times. A
few tender dandelion leaves, when
procurable, are relished once a week.
Some breeders like to use freshly
sprouted seed at the stage when the
sprout is a quarter of an inch long or
less and also greens they raise themselves
from the regular bird seed mixture.
The early part of January is a
good time to practice raising these
greens. Just be sure that there is no
evidence of mold growth on the
sprouted seed when it is fed.</p>
<p>Small diameter perches for the
chicks just weaned can be secured in
advance. A visit to your shrubs or
grape arbor will easily provide a handful
of suitable length perches of moderately
rough surface, from &frac14;&Prime; to &#8540;&Prime;
in diameter. Starting about the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
of March a little niger seed should be
given the hen in a treat cup two or
three times weekly. This oily seed
should help prevent egg binding. At
this time both the solid and wire partitions
can be put back in the breeding
cage, and the cock changed to his
half of the cage.</p>
<h3 id="c68">THE MATING</h3>
<p>At mating time the hen is lively and
alert and will usually call loudly. The
cock will sing lustily and dance on
the perch with lowered wings while
singing. When these signs occur, remove
the solid partition, leaving the
wire partition in place. When you
see the cock feeding the hen through
the bars, remove the wire too, and let
the birds run together. They may
quarrel for a short while, but will
soon become devoted. Place the lined
nest in the cage along with a little
nesting material.</p>
<h3 id="c69">ROUND ONE&mdash;THE FIRST NEST</h3>
<p>Do not be in a hurry for the hen to
lay. She will produce her egg at her
own time and no sooner. As soon as
it is laid, take it out of the nest with
a teaspoon and place it in the small
box you prepared earlier, replacing
it with a dummy egg. Remove the
second egg likewise. Turn the removed
eggs daily. As a general rule an egg
is laid every morning until a clutch
of from four to six eggs is completed.
There are occasions when a hen will
produce only two or three eggs to a
clutch, and many times she will skip
a day between eggs. When the third
egg is laid, remove the dummy egg,
dust the nest again with insect powder,
and place the other eggs back in
the nest. The evening is a good time
to do this.</p>
<p>When the hen takes to her nest
entirely, separate the cock and hen
by replacing the wire partition. The
hen&rsquo;s bath should be withheld for the
first eleven days she sits. On the sixth
day you should candle the eggs. Cut
an oval hole slightly smaller than the
dimension of an egg in the bottom of
a small cardboard box, and place an
egg on the hole. From beneath, shine
your flashlight through the egg. If
the egg is clear it is infertile, but if
slightly red with a dark spot it is
fertile. If the eggs are all clear remove
them and the nest, and after a
few days start over, letting the cock
run with the hen again. If there are
fertile eggs, place them back in the
nest, where the hen will continue
through the setting period, which is
fourteen days from the day she took
to the nest steadily.</p>
<p>After the eleventh day allow her to
bathe daily as the moisture from her
feathers tends to soften the egg shells
and is an aid to the chicks in picking
their way through.</p>
<p>When the hen takes to the nest, it is
a good plan, because of her inactivity,
to restrict her diet somewhat&mdash;particularly
the egg food and greens. She
will likely leave much of this anyway,
and she should never take any that
has soured, as she may do if it is left
in the cage partly uneaten all day.</p>
<h3 id="c70">AFTER THE HATCHING</h3>
<p>Upon hatching, egg food should be
given three times a day in addition
to the regular seed mixture. The first
feeding each day should be given as
early in the morning as possible. See
&ldquo;<a href="#c16">Egg Food</a>&rdquo; under &ldquo;<a href="#c5">General Care</a>.&rdquo;
Fresh greens may be fed daily. Newly
hatched youngsters require very small
amounts of food. &ldquo;Feed little and
often,&rdquo; is a good rule to follow. You
will soon be able to judge the amount,
bearing in mind that quantity should
be increased as the youngsters grow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
When the nestlings are about six days
old their eyes will have opened, and
when they are around ten days old
the partition can be withdrawn and
the cock allowed to rejoin the hen.
However, if the hen is not feeding
the young as she should, or if she
doesn&rsquo;t stay on the nest sufficiently
to keep the chicks warm, the cock
should be allowed to return at once.</p>
<p>Many successful breeders prepare
&ldquo;soaked seed&rdquo; for morning and evening
feedings for the hen and nestlings
from hatching time to six weeks later.
Prepare by putting a little of your
regular seed mixture to soak at the
morning feeding. Then, at the evening
feeding, stir this well, strain, and
put to soak again in fresh water. On
the following morning, stir, rinse in
fresh water, strain, dry, and this
&ldquo;soaked&rdquo; seed is ready to use. Soaked
seed for the evening feed is started
each evening, strained, put to soak
again each morning, and in the
evening strained, rinsed, dried between
paper towels, and fed.</p>
<p>Soaked seed often does wonders for
a nonfeeding hen, and it is valuable
for chicks after they are separated
from the hen. As the birds gain in age,
gradually increase the seed proportion
and cut down soft foods, until they
are about six weeks old. At this age
they are able to crack their own
seeds, and the regular French&rsquo;s Bird
Seed and Biscuit may be given them
together with feedings of egg food
about three times a week until they
have completed their moult.</p>
<h3 id="c71">THE SECOND ROUND</h3>
<p>Between sixteen and twenty-one days
after the hatching, the hen will probably
show signs of wanting to go to
nest again. Place the second nest in
the opposite corner of the cage, and
stuff bits of fresh nesting material
between the cage bars near the new
nest. Be sure that enough is allowed,
otherwise she will pull feathers out
of the young birds. When the hen
lays her first egg, it should be removed
as before, and Round One repeated.
As soon as she takes to her second
nest entirely, the chicks from Round
One and the cock should be moved
to the other half of the cage, and
separated from the hen by the wire
partition.</p>
<p>Although a very vigorous hen and
a good feeding cock can hatch three
or four nests in a season, best results
are had by not allowing more than
two. If the nesting is finished early
in June, the parents and chicks will
be in condition for the moult in late
summer. The added strain of more
than two nests will likely make the
birds unreliable for breeding the following
season.</p>
<h3 id="c72">DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF</h3>
<p>&mdash;A nestling falls out of the nest the
first few days. When this happens
pick up the young bird and warm it
in your hands for a few minutes and
then, if it is alive, place it back in
the nest.</p>
<p>&mdash;One or more of the eggs do not
hatch, though fertile. Sometimes a
chick is too weak to pick through the
shell which may be unusually hard
due to excessive dryness if the hen
does not bathe. Should many of the
eggs turn out this way, put a few
teaspoonfuls of common salt, or even
rock salt in the bottom of the nest
pan, below the lining, as this will attract
(and retain) moisture from the
air. There are many other reasons
why fertile eggs do not hatch, most
of them indicating a weakness in the
embryo. However, one of the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
common causes is chilling of the eggs
due to the hen leaving the nest for too
long a time. A sudden cold spell may
have the same effect.</p>
<p>&mdash;One or more of the hatchlings are
found dead in the nest. Remove at
once. Accidental smothering or crushing
by the hen is likely the cause, or
if the eggs hatch out over a period of
two or three days, the first hatchlings
may be getting practically all the
food. That is why you should remove
the first two eggs, so that all hatch as
nearly as possible at the same time.</p>
<p>&mdash;The hen you are expecting to lay
again is found crouching in a corner
of the cage, trembling and quite apparently
in severe pain. She is probably
suffering from egg-binding, and
must be attended to at once. Take
the hen very gently in your hand,
and put three or four drops of olive
oil in her beak. Carefully place her
back in the cage, and after a short
time the egg will be passed safely.</p>
<p>&mdash;The &ldquo;sweating hen&rdquo; problem occurs.
Her breast feathers will have a
moist appearance leading one to believe
that she is sweating. What actually
happens is that the hen loses
condition, probably as the result of
eating food that is sour, stale, or too
sloppy, and this is passed on to the
baby chicks. Diarrhoea results. Normally
during the first week or so, the
excreta from the young is expelled in
a tiny transparent bag which the hen
picks up in one piece when cleaning
the nest. Being unable to do this if the
young have diarrhoea, her feathers
become sticky and matted.</p>
<p>&mdash;The hen starts picking feathers
from the backs of the Round One
chicks to provide nesting for the second
nest even though ample nesting material
is supplied. When this happens
separate the cock and the chicks from
the hen, using the wire partition.</p>
<h3 id="c73">THE NON-FEEDING HEN</h3>
<p>It is normal for a hen to stop feeding
her babies when she takes to her second
nest of eggs. The cock bird can usually
be depended upon to continue the
job. However, a hen sometimes stops
feeding at an earlier time, often because
of an upset condition resulting
from improper feeding&mdash;or from a
fright. Such things as stale or soured
soft foods, food deficiencies, or lack
of sufficient fresh green food are most
often the root of the trouble, although
overfat and lazy hens sometimes seem
to find proper feeding too much
trouble. Try allowing the cock to
carry on alone, giving the hen normal
feeding until she resumes her duty.
When the chicks are not being fed by
either bird, it is advisable to divide
the nestlings among the other nests
if you have other pairs with chicks
about the same age.</p>
<p>Otherwise, handfeeding is imperative.
Chew either Pablum or oat flakes
and when mushy, feed it to the babies
from the end of a toothpick. In a day
or two the parents may resume feedings.
Should they not, the chewed
food will have to be supplemented
with greens, egg yolk, and after the
chicks are ten days old, a little soft
cuttle bone scraped from the soft side
of the bone sprinkled over the mush.
A few grains of table salt should also
be added.</p>
<p>If a chick is out of the nest, it is
likely to be afraid and refuse to open
its beak for food. Take such a bird in
your left hand, pry open the beak
with the right thumb nail and hold
it open with the nails of your left
thumb and forefinger. Avoid injury
either to the bird&rsquo;s eyes or through
too firm a hold. Keep the head elevated
for easy swallowing and feed
from a toothpick. Always feed warm
food. A little milk sop from toasted
whole wheat bread makes a good
change. The babies usually will begin
to feed themselves a few days after
leaving the nest and can then be given
moist nestling food, sprouted rape
seeds, and cracked seeds prepared
from regular French&rsquo;s Bird Seed.</p>

<h3 id="c75">SLIP CLAW</h3>
<p>In slip claw the bird is unable to
grasp the perch normally because the
back claw is bent forward between
the front claws. Treat by binding the
affected claw back against the shank
of the leg with adhesive tape. Let the
binding remain for a week to ten days,
but be sure that it is not so tight as
to stop circulation.</p>
<h3 id="c76">COLOR BRED CANARIES</h3>
<p>Ever since it was discovered some
years ago that the hybrid chicks resulting
from crossing the canary and
the South American Black-hooded
Red Siskin were sometimes fertile
when bred back to canaries and that
this crossing could produce a natural
red tint in the canary feathering,
there has been much experimentation
by breeders all over the world in an
endeavor to produce an all red canary.
To date some beautiful tints of orange,
copper, and pink have been produced
and a truly red canary seems a possibility.
This discovery of a fertile
hybrid has proved a major contribution
to canary breeding, and breeders
today are reexamining some of the
other crosses between canaries and
related wild birds for fertility.</p>
<p>For the amateur who has gained
a degree of proficiency in handling
canaries, there is hardly a more fascinating
phase of the hobby. We welcome
questions from those who undertake
this work.</p>
<h3 id="c77">DISTINGUISHING THE SEX OF CANARIES</h3>
<p>We have seen many experts sex
canaries, and have come to the conclusion
that the best proof that a
canary is a hen occurs when she produces
an egg, and likewise, that her
companion is a male, if the egg is
fertile. However, there are many
other characteristics associated with
the sex differences of canaries.</p>
<p>For example, the cock canary:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Sings</dt>
<dt>2. Has a bolder eye and look about the head</dt>
<dt>3. When in breeding condition in the spring, has an elevated vent which definitely protrudes like a wart.</dt></dl>
<p>The hen canary, by contrast,</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Does not sing</dt>
<dt>2. Is not so bold about the eye and head</dt>
<dt>3. Has a flat, unelevated vent.</dt></dl>
<p>These characteristics are all subject
to exceptions. We find good males
that do not sing, good hens that do
sing; males of one strain having a
female appearance about the head
when compared with hens of a heavy
strain of birds, and vice versa. There
are also cases where the vent areas of
both male and female are very similar
except when in breeding condition.</p>
<p>Errors are most likely when a
breeder sexes spring hatched canaries
in the fall. The breeder will separate
the observed singers from the non-singers,
as male and female. Then he
goes through the non-singers for some
indication in the appearance of the
head or vent area, and makes a further
tentative separation. Such division
can only be moderately reliable, because
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
only a few strongly sexed young
males tend to come into breeding condition
early. An error of as much as
25% is not unusual in fall sexing.</p>
<p>For your guidance a good indication
of a young male canary is that
he sings with a noticeable swelling of
the throat. From January and February
on through June the male in
breeding condition will have a noticeably
raised vent as well as strong song.
In pairing birds it may be expected
that any male in breeding condition
will pair with any female in breeding
condition, providing there is not a
very great difference in size.</p>

<h2 id="c78"><span class="small"><i>Canary Accidents And Illnesses</i></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="Frenchy" width="336" height="200" />
</div>
<p>With good food and care, and barring
accident, there is no reason why
a healthy canary from healthy parents
should live less than a normal span
of 12 to 14 years before old age causes
a breakdown. The ailing singer is not
difficult to pick out. Usually the first
sign is that he stops singing. Whether
the bird is cock or hen, a sudden
change from its normal sleek appearance
and lively action bears immediate
study.</p>
<h3 id="c79">BALDNESS</h3>
<p>When two crested canaries are bred
together some of the chicks will be
permanently bald. Another cause,
apparently, is the tendency for some
birds to constantly rub their heads
against the perch or bars of the cage.
This condition is sometimes accompanied,
or perhaps caused by the
presence of lice.</p>
<p>Sometimes baldness is caused by
an incomplete moult, the lost feathers
not having been replaced during the
regular moulting season. Sometimes
severe changes in the weather during
the moult, or food deficiency during
the moult is the cause of incomplete
feather growth.</p>
<p>There is no treatment for inherited
baldness. If lice or mites are present,
treat the bird as indicated under
&ldquo;<a href="#c88">Mites</a>.&rdquo; See that the bird has a normal
seed diet with plenty of greens,
a cuttle bone in the cage, plus egg
food and moulting food two or three
times each week. Allow the bird to
exercise as much as possible, and there
is a good chance that during the next
regular moult the feathers will return.</p>
<h3 id="c80">BLINDNESS</h3>
<p>There is no cure for blindness. We
have known birds to be totally blind
for months before the condition was
observed by the owner. There is apparently
no pain, and blind birds
sometimes sing freely. However, they
move about very little, and while the
variety and balance of their diet must
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
be maintained, they should not be
fed as much as normal birds.</p>
<h3 id="c81">BROKEN BONES</h3>
<p>Wing, upper leg, and toe breaks
should be allowed to heal with no
assistance other than seeing that the
bird is not disturbed. Breaks in the
lower leg can often be set and splinted
successfully with thin cotton padding
on the leg and pieces of toothpicks
bound snugly with cotton thread, but
not so tightly as to cut off circulation.</p>
<p>Always remove the swing and all
high perches from the cage, and arrange
food and water so that the bird
can get at them with as little movement
as possible.</p>
<h3 id="c82">BROKEN FEATHERS</h3>
<p>When tail and flight feathers are
broken, they will grow in again at
once if they are carefully pulled out.
If it is near the regular moulting
season, it is advisable to let them be
shed naturally.</p>
<h3 id="c83">CHILLS AND COLDS</h3>
<p>A chill or a cold in a canary is recognized
by the bird sneezing and sitting
with its feathers puffed up. Sometimes
there is hoarseness, and if the nasal
discharge is very heavy there may be
complete loss of voice, temporarily.
The cold will usually work itself off
if the bird is given reasonable care.
Sometimes, however, if the bird is in
a more or less rundown condition and
the infection is strong, a more serious
condition such as pneumonia will
result quickly.</p>
<p>Keep the bird free from drafts, and
locate the cage where the temperature
is as even as possible and warm rather
than cold. Return to a regular diet
with plenty of green foods. If the
room cools off at night, cover the
cage and avoid awakening the pet at
night. Test for the presence of mites.
If some are found, treat as directed
under &ldquo;<a href="#c88">Mites</a>.&rdquo; Observe the droppings
and make adjustments in the
food if they are not normal as explained
under &ldquo;Constipation and Diarrhoea&rdquo;
below.</p>
<p>In addition to ten drops of French&rsquo;s
Iron Compound in the drinking water
daily, feed a teaspoonful of egg food,
fresh each day.</p>
<h3 id="c84">CONSTIPATION AND DIARRHOEA</h3>
<p>Constipation is a digestive disturbance
usually caused by feeding an insufficient
quantity of green foods. The
correction is to give a variety of green
foods, including sprouted seed, regularly.
Lettuce, sweet apple, Chickweed,
watercress, and dandelion are
beneficial. Green food should always
be crisp, clean and fresh. When a bird
is being fed generous amounts of fresh
green foods, the natural result will
be more liquid droppings. This should
not be confused with diarrhoea, a
condition in which the droppings are
usually excessively watery.</p>
<p>There are many possible causes for
diarrhoea. The diet itself may be unnatural
for the bird, or it may be inadequate
to the seasonal needs of the
bird. For example, in the breeding
and moulting seasons freshly prepared
egg food should be given. Diarrhoea
may also be merely an accompaniment
of an active disease.
The bird should be kept warm. A
change of diet will usually afford
relief. Temporarily, eliminate rich
and stimulating foods from the diet.
Supply as much of the following mixture
daily as the bird will eat:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1 slice whole wheat bread</dt>
<dt>3 tablespoons steel-cut oats or Quick Mother&rsquo;s Oats</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon poppy seed</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon scraped cuttle bone</dt>
<dt>Toast bread until thoroughly brown on both sides and quite dry inside. Then crush it to small seed size particles and add the remaining ingredients.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Give buttermilk or tea in place of
drinking water for 3 or 4 days.</p>
<p>If the disorder persists, or if the
droppings are off-color and evil smelling,
write us for further guidance,
describing the conditions and what
you have done.</p>
<h3 id="c85">CUTTING BEAK AND CLAWS</h3>
<p>Overgrown nails and claws should be
trimmed, using a sharp nail clipper
or small nail scissors. In the case of
the beak, just trim off the overhang&mdash;to
a point, if possible. It is usually
only the larger rear and the middle
front nails that become overgrown.
Holding the claw up to the light, cut
between the end of the nail and the
red vein. There will be no bleeding
unless you accidentally cut into the
vein, in which case touch the end of
the claw with a styptic pencil or a
spot of iodine.</p>
<h3 id="c86">FITS&mdash;PAROXYSMS</h3>
<p>Fright, sudden chills or overexposure
to hot sunlight may upset a bird
severely. When no more than fainting
is involved, a few drops of water
sprinkled on the bird&rsquo;s head will bring
it around, after which see that it is
allowed quiet, and treat it with extreme
gentleness.</p>
<p>Under other conditions, a bird may
suddenly drop off his perch, unconscious,
in the midst of a song or other
normal activity. In these cases the
cause is usually quite different, and
no treatment other than correct diet
can be offered. The pet may survive
one or two such attacks and live for
years afterward.</p>
<h3 id="c87">LOSS OF SONG</h3>
<p>Fright, poor health, or loss of sexual
vigor are generally the cause of loss
of song.</p>
<p>Sudden fright is one of the chief
causes and may occur through the
cage being accidentally upset, or an
attack by a cat. Some aviary birds
are so lacking in contact with people
that they seem severely frightened
if a stranger approaches closely. Be
gentle with canaries and endeavor to
protect them from such frights. The
loss of song may last from a day or so
to several weeks, but it can usually be
overcome through playing the radio
or phonograph. Sometimes the noise
of a vacuum cleaner provides the
stimulation needed.</p>
<p>Poor health is indicated when a
cold has persisted for several weeks,
when feathers are shed out of season,
when the digestive system is upset,
when the bird is overfat, or when the
bird is troubled with mites or sore
feet. Treat for such ailments first, and
then provide the song stimuli as
mentioned above.</p>
<p>Song is a strong secondary sexual
characteristic of the normal male
canary. Old or weakly sexed males
usually do not sing as often or as vigorously
as normal males, even though
in perfect health.</p>
<p>When a canary has never sung,
there is always the possibility that it
is a normal hen and will never do so.
Hen canaries have been known to inherit
rather strong male characteristics
and to sing frequently but usually
without the vigor and fullness characteristic
of normal males.</p>
<p>When a canary is apparently in
good health and all other stimuli have
failed to secure the return of song,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
try placing a good singing canary in
an adjoining room where it can be
heard but not seen by the silent bird.</p>
<h3 id="c88">MITES</h3>
<p>There are many different kinds of
mites and lice which live on birds as
their natural hosts. The biting grey
lice live on the scales of the bird&rsquo;s skin,
feet and legs, or upon its feathers. Red
mites suck the blood of the host and
generally leave the bird in daylight
and return to it at night. The biting
lice seldom leave the bird, and are
most difficult to find. They are sometimes
removed when the bird combs
out his feathers with his beak. Red
mites are more easily located. Place
a white cloth over the cage at night,
and if the mites are present, they will
be found as little red specks on the
cloth in the morning. Run a hot iron
over the cloth to destroy them.</p>
<p>Lice cause discomfort and weaken
the bird. The one rule to follow in
correcting the condition is routine and
complete cleanliness. Dismantle the
cage and stand, and scrub every part
thoroughly with a hot, strong suds.
Dust the bird with a good lice powder
and see that it is allowed to bathe
regularly. This program may not rid
the bird of lice completely or all at
once, but it will keep the number of
lice below the danger point.</p>
<p>In aviaries where many birds are
housed in a special room, a poultry
type spraying technique can be used
effectively along with regular cleaning
practice. We will be glad to make
suggestions if you write us about your
specific problem.</p>
<h3 id="c89">MOULTING&mdash;LOSS OF FEATHERS</h3>
<p>It is normal for a bird to replace its
feathers with new growth each year.
Moulting usually starts in July, but
the actual date may vary in different
climates. A complete moult may take
about three months. It is not a disease,
but the drain on the vitality of the
bird requires that he be given particular
care and special supplementary
feeding. The first symptoms to be
noticed are a general lassitude and
drowsiness followed in a few days by
a loose feather or two on the floor of
the cage. In order that this normal
yearly occurrence will proceed as uneventfully
as possible, we suggest the
following procedure:</p>
<p>Keep a French&rsquo;s Bird Biscuit and
Cuttle Bone in the cage at all times,
and add eight to ten drops of French&rsquo;s
Iron Compound to the drinking water
occasionally. By way of supplemental
feeding, add about &frac14; teaspoonful of
either flaxseeds or niger seeds to the
French&rsquo;s Bird Seed daily. Two or
three times a week give a portion of
hard cooked egg that has been mixed
with toasted bread crumbs, etc., see
under &ldquo;<a href="#c16">Egg Food</a>,&rdquo; in &ldquo;<a href="#c5">General Care</a>&rdquo;
section. About half a teaspoonful
should be sufficient with each feeding.
In addition, feed French&rsquo;s Moulting
Food in place of French&rsquo;s Song Food
two or three times a week and continue
the cultivated and wild green
foods. It is normal for most males to
lose their song during the moult. They
usually start singing again within a
few weeks after the new feathers appear.</p>
<p>When song is first resumed the
adult bird may sing much like a baby
bird. However, the volume should
increase to its full capacity within a
short time.</p>
<p>Spring hatched canaries going
through their first moult usually shed
only the soft body feathers. Only after
a canary is a year old does it shed the
tail and wing feathers as well as the
body feathers.</p>
<p>Birds have been known to skip the
entire moult and apparently be none
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
the worse for it. Also, some canaries
continue to sing right through the
whole process, with no interruption.</p>
<p>Loss of feathers at other than the
regular moult indicates a weakened
condition and is not normal or desirable.
Sometimes referred to as soft
moult, this condition may be due to
interruptions of the bird&rsquo;s sleep when
a light in the room is turned on and
off at night. Wrong feeding is an important
cause, and keeping the bird
in a hot, steamy atmosphere will also
lead to this trouble.</p>
<p>Feed freshly made egg food, as
above, daily for two weeks or so, and
place French&rsquo;s Iron Compound in its
drinking water (10 drops daily) for
the same period. See that the cage
location is changed if it is in a room
that is too warm, even for brief periods,
as is usual in a kitchen. The cage
should also be moved if it is where the
bird might be disturbed several times
during the night. Examine for lice
and make sure that mice are not keeping
your bird awake by climbing into
his cage for seed and water.</p>
<h3 id="c90">NERVOUS TICS</h3>
<p>Cage birds sometimes develop annoying
habits as a result of excess
energy and playfulness. They may
get in the habit of tugging at the paper
on the cage floor; or if they have a
band on their leg, they will sometimes
pick at it until their leg becomes
very sore. Ridding a bird of such annoying
or harmful habits will be a
good test of your ingenuity. In the
case of a leg band, the easiest thing
to do is to remove the band. A change
in the location of the cage might help.
Sometimes a new cage of different
shape or color will turn the trick.
Some owners allow their birds the
freedom of a whole room and this
usually is beneficial&mdash;providing windows
and doors are kept shut.</p>
<h3 id="c91">OBESITY</h3>
<p>When a canary eats more than it requires
for energy, some of the excess
eventually accumulates as fat. Birds
differ individually in the amount of
food necessary. Some do much better
in a large cage where they have more
chance for exercise and all birds
benefit by free flying.</p>
<p>A bird usually eats from daylight
to dark and in some homes &ldquo;lights
out&rdquo; comes rather late. Try to let the
bird keep a natural day, dawn to
dusk, and if he is to be kept awake
during the evening, cover his cage
part of the day.</p>
<h3 id="c92">SORE EYES</h3>
<p>Sore and inflamed eyes or lids
should be treated with 2% yellow
oxide of mercury ointment, obtainable
from your druggist in a long
necked metal tube. Squeeze a tiny
amount beneath each lid and wipe
the excess on the outside of the lids.
Cover the perches with a wrap of soft
cloth tied in place in order to prevent
irritation when the bird rubs its eyes
on the perch.</p>
<h3 id="c93">SORE FEET AND LEGS</h3>
<p>As with many conditions that differ
from normal, sore feet and legs are
generally only the end result of conditions
which may have no apparent
connection. However, if the cage and
perches are not kept clean, if the bird
does not bathe regularly, or if the
perches are the wrong size or are
coated with gravel, it becomes necessary
to correct these obvious errors
in management. When a bird is ailing
it will often refuse its bath, and its
feet are likely to become quite dirty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
The corrective measure here is to put
the bird on a normal seed and green
food diet with rich additions such as
egg food only during the moulting
and breeding seasons.</p>
<p>In older birds, scales on the legs
and toes will very often build up
rather than slough off, causing an unsightly
and sometimes a painful condition.
These can be softened with a
little olive oil and gently removed
without injury to the bird. Heavy callouses
on the bottom of a bird&rsquo;s feet
may be due to improper perching or
to a fungus growth. In hot, humid
climates the latter is a possibility,
and it is suggested that you ask your
druggist for a small amount of one of
the new fungicides for trial. Perches
should be made of soft wood and
should never be gravel coated.</p>
<p>If the sore feet are accompanied by
overgrown claws it may be that a
joint was strained due to the claw
catching somewhere in the cage. The
remedy, of course, is to keep the claws
properly trimmed.</p>
<h3 id="c94">WHEEZING</h3>
<p>Wheezing in a canary is not an uncommon
disorder and is usually due
to the effects of a cold. It may also be
due to an overfat condition. If either
of these conditions are present, treat
as indicated. Otherwise, write us
giving full details.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
